<p>Database Systems Corp Nevertheless, today the diversity of office phone systems for small company is big and are based on different technology platforms. More than a third of companies now utilize VoIP as their go-to system. A hosted system provides all PBX services, applications and functions, and it preserves software in the cloud instead of on a server like digital systems.

So if various calls come at the very same time, then the demand is rerouted to other available phones in the system.</p>
<p>VoIP security from end to end for all calls is now a business necessity.
